TODO
- Automatically open Article if only one unread article in list
- https-support with own Certificates
- only refresh feedlist if &op=getConfig returns a new number of feeds
- Watch for removed sdcard
- Update unread-counts on startup (needs API method for getCounters on Tiny Tiny RSS)


IN PROGRESS
- Cache Articles or download for offline usage and develop a good strategy for when to use which data and when to fetch new data.


0.5.0
- Added local caching in DB for Articles, Feeds and Categories.
- On startup no update is performed at the moment, press Menu->Update for a full update or Refresh for Update of Headlines and Feeds
- HTML content is saved base64-encoded to avoid syntax-problems while inserting
- Removed Tabs, they were unneccessary since we have uncategorized Feeds as a virtual category now

- Share Article-URL via Twitter, Mail...
- Zoom-Button for Articles

- Automatically leave FeedHeadlineView if there are no items (see FeedHeadlineListActivity.java:207)
- Disabled concurrent modifications in Refresher.java and Updater.java because of Exceptions (see comments in source)
