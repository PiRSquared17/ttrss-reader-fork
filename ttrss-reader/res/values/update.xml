    <item>Version 1.1
            \n * Added display-preference for dark-background and white text
            \n * Added preference "Start ImageCache only on Wifi", prevents the automatically scheduled ImageCache to run on a mobile connection

            </item>
    
    <item>Version 1.09
            \n * Vibrate when last article is reached, not only when trying to move further but the moment you reach it
            \n * Changed buttons and layout for article-browsing
            \n * Added left-hand-mode for landscape display
            \n * Removed ArticleCache from menu. Same thing happens automatically when CategoryView is opened.
            \n * Fixed Issue #75 (Own keystore doesn\'t work any more)
            \n * Fixed Bug: Articles which had been marked while beeing offline where not synchronized with the server
            \n * Fixed ImageCache for unreliable connections.

            </item>

            \n * Fixed connectivity-problems (no more endless waiting with spinning activity-wheel)
            \n * Added preference to disable swipe and instead use buttons for browsing articles. Still a bit buggy.
            </item>

            \n * Refreshing more often during update, show progress

            \n * Store articles marked as read also for whole feeds/categoires. You can mark a feed as read while working offline, all articles in it the moment you marked it read will be synchronized with the server when you get online next time.
            \n * Fixed a problem with articles beeing marked as read only when opening the feed
            </item>

            \n \n Please contact me if this update introduced new issues with the HTTP-Auth, I can\'t test this here so I have to rely on your feedback.
